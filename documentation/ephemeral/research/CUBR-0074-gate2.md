# CUBR-0074 Gate 2: reference-channel gate

**Status:** preregistered before adapter work or candidate measurement

## Gate

The existing 0074 corpus-parity criteria remain the ratio gate:

- `ratio_vs_brotli11 <= 1.00` is the continuation gate.
- `ratio_vs_brotli11 <= 0.92` is the stronger WIN gate.
- `real_world_sample_share >= 0.80` remains required.
- `decode_throughput_vs_brotli5 >= 0.50` is the fixed decode gate.
- Exact byte-for-byte round-trip is required for every resource in all measured cells.

The throughput factor is 0.50 because decoding is on the browser critical path. A
candidate must deliver at least half of Brotli-5's decode throughput, allowing at
most twice the decode latency of the dynamic-response baseline. This permits one
equal-sized decode-latency budget for a new codec while rejecting a four-times-slower
decoder that would not be a credible browser delivery path. Brotli-11 remains the
density baseline; Brotli-5 is the speed baseline actually used for dynamic web
responses.

## Reference-channel choice

Use a separate `reference_phase_a` channel for `cubrim-lowmem-decode`. It leaves the
published five-codec `PHASE_A_CODECS` tuple, its bundle verifier, and its existing
120 validated rows byte-identical. The candidate is explicitly archival and
whole-buffer: it is not normalized to `cubrim-web`, has no real Web Profile, and
must not be presented as a shipping web codec.

The reference channel will reuse the existing sample manifest, trial order,
30-trial/3-warmup protocol, subprocess sandbox, provenance, five metrics, exact
round-trip checks, and summary machinery. It will add no format, WASM, proxy,
Chromium, or standards work.

## Stop conditions

- If any existing five-codec bundle or summary changes, stop and treat it as a
  published-result regression.
- If any candidate resource fails exact round-trip, do not write numeric evaluation
  rows; retain only a journaled void.
- Do not resolve the 0074 dependency or write evaluation/evidence/derived rows until
  every candidate cell is complete and validated.
